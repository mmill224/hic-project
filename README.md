The overall idea of this is to make a note taking app that allows users to create, filter, and delete notes. 

## Contributing:
Make or choose an issue, then clone the repo, make a branch, write your feature, then make a pull request with a helpful description. Allow another contibutor to review your code before merging into main if possible. Ask in the discord if needed.
Matt is happy to help.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
